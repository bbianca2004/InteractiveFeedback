Welcome to the Tutoring Phase

You'll first see a math problem and submit an initial solution(even if you don't know how to solve it, that is perfectly fine, just try your best!). The AI tutor will respond with initial feedback. From there, you can engage in a back-and-forth discussion to improve your understanding and your solution.

Please be as thoughtful and detailed as you can in your messages.
"""

FOLLOWUP_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Follow-Up Problem

Now you'll try solving a similar problem in one trial. The AI will give you feedback so give it your best shot at a solution.

This helps us measure how well the tutor helped you learn in the previous interaction.
"""

RUBRIC_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Rate Your Experience

Please reflect on the tutor's helpfulness. Rate each aspect on a 1-5 scale.

Be honest! This helps us improve future AI tutoring systems.
