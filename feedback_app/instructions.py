DIALOGUE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Welcome to the Tutoring Phase

You'll first see a math problem and submit your one-shot solution. The AI tutor will respond with initial feedback. From there, you can engage in a back-and-forth discussion to improve your understanding.

Please be as thoughtful and detailed as you can in your messages.
"""

FOLLOWUP_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Follow-Up Problem

Now you'll try solving a similar problem in one shot. The AI will give you feedback â€” try your best without copying from earlier.

This helps us measure how well the tutor helped you learn.
"""

RUBRIC_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Rate Your Experience

Please reflect on the tutor's helpfulness. Rate each aspect on a 1-5 scale.

Be honest! This helps us improve future AI tutoring systems.
