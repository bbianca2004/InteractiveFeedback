### What this is about  
Youâ€™ll be trying out an **AI tutoring system** designed to support student learning in *discrete mathematics (counting)*.  
The goal is to see whether interactive feedback can help students think more deeply and reflect on their reasoning.  

---

### What youâ€™ll do  
1. Work through **three problems** â€“ one easy, one medium, one hard.  
2. For each, write your own **detailed solution** (the tutor wonâ€™t accept just a number).  
3. The AI tutor will give **initial feedback**, and you can then have a short **back-and-forth conversation** to improve your solution.  
4. After both stages, youâ€™ll rate the tutorâ€™s response on a few simple rubrics.  
5. Finally, youâ€™ll get a **follow-up problem** to test whether the feedback helped.  

---

### What to keep in mind  
- The problems are **intro-level (CS-101)** â€“ easy on purpose, since the focus is interaction, not difficulty.  
- Please note anything that feels **confusing, buggy, or unhelpful**. Your impressions are just as valuable as your answers.  
- At the end, you can leave **general feedback**, or email me directly at [bianca.pitu@epfl.ch](mailto:bianca.pitu@epfl.ch).  

---

### One small ask  
Even if the process feels long or you lose motivation, please try to **complete all three problems**.  
Even quick, low-effort answers are better than stopping halfway.  

---

### Extra  
If youâ€™d like, you can **repeat the study** and experiment with the tutor. Every run gives us more insights!

### ðŸ’š Thank you  
Thank you so much for your interest in this study, your time and feedback mean a lot!
