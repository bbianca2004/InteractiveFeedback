1. Prove that it is an equivalence relation.
Define the function f : R × R →R by f(a, b) = a −b. Then, for any two pairs p, q ∈R × R, we
have p ∼q if and only if f(p) = f(q). It is then easy to see that the relation is reflexive (because
f(p) = f(p)), symmetric (because f(p) = f(q) implies f(q) = f(p)), and transitive (because
f(p) = f(q) and f(q) = f(r) implies f(p) = f(r)).","2. Prove that the set of equivalence classes of ∼is uncountable.
Let Q be the partition of R×R induced by the relation ∼(i.e., Q is the set of equivalence classes).
We define a function F : Q →R as follows: for any equivalence class C ∈Q, choose p ∈C and let
F(C) = f(p). This function is well defined because if q ∈C is an other element of the class then
f(q) = f(p). In other words,
F : Q −→R : C 7−→f(p) for any p ∈C.
It is surjective: for any x ∈R, let C be the class of (x, 0), then F(C) = f(x, 0) = x. It is injective:
if F(C) = F(D) for C, D ∈Q, then for any pairs p ∈C and q ∈D we have f(p) = f(q). Then
p ∼q, and therefore p and q must be in the same equivalence class, hence C = D. So F is a
bijection. Since R is uncountable, Q is also uncountable.",,

This requires a total of 60 cables. Clearly any set of 10 or less computers can simultaneously access

one printer would be connected to at most ⌊59/10⌋= 5 computers. (If all printers were connected to at

You need to prove that (S x T, ⪯) has those required properties, so it can be considered a poset.

In general, think about assignments that go ""Show that [a] is [b]"" as ""Show that [a] that has the required properties to be called [b]""

if and only if s ⪯1 u and t ⪯2 v.
A relation R on a set A is a partial ordering if the relation R is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transi-
tive. (S, R) is then called a poset.
PROOF (S × T, ⪯) is a poset if and only if the relation R = {((s, t), (u, v))|(s, t) ⪯(u, v)} is a par-
tial ordering.
(S, ⪯1) and (T, ⪯2) are posets, thus the relations R1 = {(s, u)|s ⪯1 u} and R2 = {(t, v)|t ⪯1 v} are
both reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
Reflexive
Let (s, t) ∈S × T, where s ∈S and t ∈T.
Since R1 = {(s, u)|s ⪯1 u} and R2 = {(t, v)|t ⪯1 v} are both reflexive:
s ⪯1 s
t ⪯2 t
(s, t) ⪯(u, v) if and only if s ⪯1 u and t ⪯2 v
(s, t) ⪯(s, t)
which implies ((s, t), (s, t)) ∈R and thus R is reflexive.
Antisymmetric

(s, t) ⪯(u, v)
(u, v) ⪯(s, t)
2
(s, t) ⪯(u, v) if and only if s ⪯1 u and t ⪯2 v
s ⪯1 u
u ⪯1 s
t ⪯2 v
v ⪯2 t
Since R1 = {(s, u)|s ⪯1 u} and R2 = {(t, v)|t ⪯2 v} are both antisymmetric:
s = u, t = v
which implies:
(s, t) = (u, v)
Thus R is antisymmetric.
Transitive
Let ((s, t), (u, v)) ∈R and ((u, v), (w, x)) ∈R
(s, t) ⪯(u, v)
(u, v) ⪯(w, x)
(s, t) ⪯(u, v) if and only if s ⪯1 u and t ⪯2 v
s ⪯1 u
u ⪯1 w
t ⪯2 v
v ⪯2 x
Since R1 = {(s, u)|s ⪯1 u} and R2 = {(t, v)|t ⪯2 v} are both transitive:
s ⪯1 w
t ⪯2 x
which implies:
(s, t) ⪯(w, x)
Thus R is transitive.
Conclusion: R is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. Then R is a partial ordering and (S × T, R) is
a poset.",,,

Let P(n) be “Ln = fn−1 + fn+1”
Basis step: n = 2 and n = 3

A function A -> B that is not onto can be created by simply not reaching all values in the codomain. So the function would have to reach any number < n of values in the codomain. That's where the sum comes from: you restrict the codomain to a set with k elements, with k < n. For each k, you have C(n, k) possibilities to actually pick the values in the function's range.

You started by considering the men which yields P(n, n) = n! possible permutations.

Then you ""correctly"" pointed out that the women can distribute themselves on the n+1 remaining spots. We can try to visualize this with the example n=3:

_x_x_x_ 

x:=men, _:= possible spot to fill with a woman, y:= women

Since the n women have n+1 places, there's always one spot going to be left free. However, the exercise doesn't allow for the gap to be anywhere else than in the beginning or in the end since otherwise this would break the alternating rhythm between men and women.

yx_xyxy = yxxyxy (not allowed)

P(n+1, n) means that you choose n from the n+1 spots and for every choice of n spots you consider all its permutations. This includes the cases where the n spots chosen DO NOT include some non-border spots.

To get to the right solution you can do the following: There are two types of patterns allowed:

Since we can combine any of these

⃝The set G is countable and the set F is not countable.
⃝The sets F and G are both not countable.","Strategy for F: we are going to show that F is countable by showing it is the union of two countable sets.
Let us denote F∞the set of real numbers with infinitely long decimal representation consisting of all
fours. Let us denote F<∞, the set of real numbers with finitely long decimal representation consisting of
all fours. We have F<∞∪F∞= F (the decimal representation is either finite or infinite), therefore, if
can show that F∞and F<∞are both countable, we will be able to conclude that F is countable.
F∞is countable: Let us denote by ∞4 a sequence of infinitely many fours. For example, 4.4444... = 4.∞4.
We can list every element of F∞in a sequence indexed by the positive integers by counting the number
of fours before the decimal point : a1 = 4.∞4, a2 = 44.∞4, a3 = 444.∞4....
Therefore F∞is countable.
F<∞is countable: We are going to follow a similar strategy as in the previous exercise with B2: we are
going to build an injective function f from F<∞to Z×Z that is going to count the number of fours before
5
the decimal point and the number of fours after the decimal point. For example f(4) = (1, 0), f(4.4) =
(1, 1), f(44.4) = (2, 1). To show that f is injective, we assume that f(a) = f(b) which implies that a and
b have the same number of 4 before and after their decimal point which implies that they are equal. f is
injective, therefore |F<∞| ≤|N × N| and because N × N is countable, we have F<∞countable.
Strategy for G: we are going to show that a subset of G is uncountable. Then, by the theorem that
states that if A is uncountable and A ⊂B, then B is uncountable, we will be able to conclude that G is
uncountable.
Let us consider G∗the subset of G consisting of be the set of real numbers between 4 and 7 with
infinitely long decimal representation consisting of all fours or sixes. For example 4.464644664644... ∈G∗
and 6.66666666... ∈G∗but 44 /∈G∗. We are going to use Cantor Diagonal Argument to show that G∗is
uncountable:
Let us assume that G∗is countable.
Therefore, we can list the elements of G∗in a sequence {an} indexed by the positive integers as follows:
a1 = d11, d12d13...
a2 = d21, d22d23...
a3 = d31, d32d33...

r is an element of G∗but it is not listed in {an}.

I believe that your result is correct, but you missed some easier simplifications:



here, you can simply remove your brackets as there are only intersections.

you then obtain:

$$\left(A\cap B\cap\overline{A}\right)\cup\left(A\cap B\cap\overline{C}\right)$$

you can simplify the left member as it's always false

so you end up with

$$\left(A\cap B\cap\overline{C}\right)$$

wich is your 9th line.

Indeed, you developped your left member from 4 to 5, to go back to it at line 9

For Exercise 6, I attempted to write a solution to check if a function is injective. I’ve attached my pseudo-code. It’s not exactly the same as the provided solution, and I’m not entirely sure if it’s correct. Could you please take a look and let me know if there’s anything I should adjust?

Thank you in advance for your time and feedback!",Homeworks,W6,,2024-10-25T20:49:54.57751+11:00,TRUE,"Hello,

Beforehand, note that your solution is very good and very close to the provided one.

Your solution is close to be perfect but there is a little problem. The problem is that for all check that you are going to make, namely for all $f(x_i) = f(x_j)$ comparaison you'll have a printed output. This is because you either print ""not injective"" or ""injective"" for each comparaison. 

Also note that you can say that a function is not injective if you find two variable $x_i, x_j$ for which $f(x_i) = f(x_j)$, but you can't say that the function is injective if you find two variables $x_i, x_j$ for which $f(x_i) \ne f(x_j)$ because you need to verify them all before saying that the function is injective.

And with this, if you would use your program, for an injective function you would have $|A|^2$ (where A is the set of preimage) print with written ""injective"" if it injective and you would have as many print, but some with ""not injective"" if your function were to not be injective. Which is very close to what we want but not exactly what we are searching for. 

Here are some correction of your code that would work :

message = ""Injective""
for i = 1 to n do :
    for j = 1 to n do:
        if f(x_i) != f(x_j) then : 
            message = ""Not injective""

True if p is False, and that ((q →p) ∧¬q) →¬p is False if p is True. It follows that the first statement
“((q →p) ∧¬q) →¬p” above is a contingency: it can be either True or False depending on the truth
values of p and q. Of course, we can also use truth table 1.

For the first part of exercise 6, I understand the solution well. However the solution that I came up with was slightly different and I was wondering if it would still be valid.



$$1.\ \left(s\ or\ x\right)\ \Rightarrow\ \left(h\ and\ r\right)$$

$$2.\ \left(s\ or\ g\right)\ \Rightarrow\ \left(r\right)$$

For the second line I assumed that it was permitted to apply a simplification inside a bracket.
After that I continued with modus tollens and de Morgan laws, like the solution suggests.

Would this be considered skipping steps or incorrectly applying the inference rules? 
Please could someone clarify this for me?

This was a good try but unfortunately it doesn't work, here is why.

The simplification that you want to do is the simplification :

$$p\wedge q\longrightarrow p$$

But the problem is that in order to use this you need to be sure that the following is true : 

$$p\wedge q$$

Because to use the Rules of Inference you have to be sure that the statement that you are using is true.

But here, as it is a part of an implication you cannot be pull it out because an implication can be true if f -> f. So your statement may be false.

More precisely in this case we know not r which implies that h and r is false. So we know for sure that it is false and thus cannot be simplify.

I was wondering about an alternative answer to prove by contradiction that

$$k^{\log_l\left(m\right)}\le Cl^{\log_k\left(m\right)};\ C>0$$

$$k^{\frac{\log_k\left(m\right)}{\log_k\left(m\right)}}\le Ck^{\log_k\left(l^{\log_k\left(m\right)}\right)}\ \Longleftrightarrow\ k^{\frac{1}{\log_k\left(l\right)}}\le C^{\frac{1}{\log_k\left(m\right)}}k^{\log_k\left(l\right)}$$

$$k^{\frac{1}{\log_k\left(l\right)}}\le1k^{\log_k\left(l\right)}\ because\ \lim_{w\longrightarrow\infty}\left(1/(\log_k(m)\right)\ =\ 1$$

$$\frac{1}{\log_k\left(l\right)}\le\log_k\left(l\right)$$

$$1\le\log_k\left(l\right)^2\ \Longleftrightarrow\ 1\le\log_k\left(l\right)\ because\ \log_k\left(l\right)>0$$

where x and y are integer values. Substituting them in the equation leads to
3(2y + 1)2 = (2x + 1)2
6y2 + 6y + 1 = 2x2 + 2x
Notice that the left hand side of the equation is always odd while the right hand side is always even.
Hence this equality is a contradiction. We conclude that there are no positive integers a and b such
that

3 = a/b and therefore that
√
3 is irrational.","2. Prove that log2(9) is irrational;
By contradiction, suppose that log2(9) is rational, i.e., there are two integers a and b such that
log2(9) = a/b with a, b > 0. Then, 9 = 2log2(9) = 2a/b, so 9b = 2a. Since 9b is odd and 2a is even,
there is a contradiction.
3. While avoiding the use of logarithms or of the fact that
√
2 is irrational, but following the noncon-

4. Use the same method to find an irrational x such that √x is rational, or show that such an x does
not exist.
Suppose that there is such an x. Then we can write √x = a

on both sides we obtain that x = a2
b2 . Since a2 and b2 are integers, it follows that a2
b2 is rational,

The goal is to compute E[X|Y ] = P∞
i=1 i·P[X = i|Y ]. We will do this ones step at a time - firstly let’s
compute P[X = i|Y ], i.e. the probability of getting a 6 for the first time on the i’th throw, conditioned
on the event that all previous throws were even. We will use Bayes’ formula:
P[X = i|Y ] = P[Y |X = i]P[X = i]

Another, easier way, to compute E[X|Y ] is the following: consider two disjoint cases - obtaining a 6
on the first throw, and not obtaining a 6 on the first throw, both conditioned on Y . Then if we get a 6
on the first throw - the number of throws is exactly 1, but if we don’t get a 6, but we get a 2 or a 4 in
stead, we have done 1 throw, and we start the game again - i.e. we add 1 to the number of throws and
throw again. We formalise this by conditioning X|Y on the events X = 1|Y and X ̸= 1|Y in order to
obtain
E[X|Y ] = E[(X|Y )|(X = 1|Y )]P[X = 1|Y ] + E[(X|Y )|(X ̸= 1|Y )]P[X ̸= 1|Y ]
We have E[(X|Y )|(X = 1|Y )] = 1 since this is the expected number of throws until the first 6, given
that the first throw is 6 (conditioned on Y ), and E[(X|Y )|(X ̸= 1|Y )] = (1 + E[X|Y ]) since this is the
expected number of throws until the first 6 given that the first throw is not a 6, conditioned on Y , as the
first throw is even, and all the throws after that one are independent from the previous one. Putting this
together we get
E[X|Y ] = 1 · P[X = 1|Y ] + (1 + E[X|Y ]) · P[X ̸= 1|Y ].
The value of P[X = 1|Y ] = 2

702,2023,81379,987,Week 8 - ex 9,"Hello, while doing the exercises all over again, I found another way of doing this exercise (in this case the first part of the exercise), and was wondering if it is correct or not. The exercise is as follows :

My approach was to say the following :

Since $i=C(i,1)$, one can also see that $i^2=2\cdot C(i,2) + C(i,1)$, $i^3=3!\cdot C(i,3) + C(3,2)\cdot i^2 + 2i$, and if we keep expanding this way, using Big-Oh notation, we find that : $i^k=k!\cdot C(i,k)+C(k,2)\cdot i^{k-1} + p(i)$ where $p(i)$ is a polynomial of order $O(i^{k-2})$.

Since the sum $\sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_i\cdot i^d}$ can be reduced to $\sum_{i=0}^{n}{i^d}$ as constants do not matter in Big-Oh notation (we could take the max and the min as in the posted solution but I skip this step to make this post shorter).

In the following lines of computations, I deliberately discard the term $i=0$ because it only contributes to a constant, and we will see that the answer stays the same.

Replacing $k$ by $d$, the sum can be expanded to $d!\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}{C(i,d)}+C(d,2)\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i^{d-1}}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p(i)}$. One can see that the term of degree $d-2$ in $p(i)$ contributes a polynomial of degree $d-1$ to $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p(i)}$. Thus, $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p(i)}\in O(n^{d-1})$.

It is also true that $C(d,2)\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i^{d-1}}=C(d,2)\cdot\frac{1}{d}\cdot n^{d} + O(n^{d-1})$, and finally, the summation identity gives us : $d!\sum_{i=1}^{n}{C(i,d)}=d!\cdot C(n+1,d+1)$.

Putting all of this together, we get that :

$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i^d}=d!\cdot C(n+1,d+1)+\frac{d-1}{2}\cdot n^d + O(n^{d-1})$

As $C(n+1,d+1)=\frac{n+1}{d+1}\cdot C(n,d)$ and using the definition of $C(n,d)$, we can manipulate the expression to get something of the form :

$\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i^d}=d!\frac{n+1}{d+1}C(n,d)+\frac{d-1}{2}n^d+O(n^{d-1})$

$=d!\frac{1}{d+1}(n+1)\frac{1}{d!}[n^d-C(d,2)n^{d-1}]+\frac{d-1}{2}n^d+O(n^{d-1})$

$=\frac{1}{d+1}n^{d+1}+[\frac{1}{d+1}(1-C(d,2))+\frac{d-1}{2}]n^d+O(n^{d-1})$

$=\frac{1}{d+1}n^{d+1}+O(n^d)$

which is clearly $\theta(n^{d+1})$.

Going back to the beginning, we can now safely say that :

$\sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_i\cdot i^d} \in \theta(n^{d+1})$.",Labs,Week 8: Induction & Recursion,,2024-01-05T03:26:54.619219+11:00,TRUE,It looks correct,92875,2024-01-07T04:54:18.265256+11:00,1,4,English: my + work; Mathematical conclusion,8,9,"Prove that n! > 2n for n ≥4.

For this problem we're interested in counting the number of strings of length N that contain three consecutive 0's. We call this condition C.

We can represent such a string by:

$$b_nb_{n-2}...b_1$$

For N=4 for example the possible strings that satisfy our condition are:

0000, 0001, 1000 => we should count 3


Now let's start figuring out a recurrence relation.

1) let's consider the left-most bit. Since it is a bit it can only be 1 or 0. So we can distinguish the two cases.

$$1b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1$$

For which we denote the count of the total number of strings that satisfy C by  

$$A_{1b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1}$$

And:

$$0b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1$$

For which we denote: 

$$A_{0b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1}$$

Since those two cases are truly distinct the total for which we're looking for can be expressed as 

$$A_N\ =\ A_{1b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1}\ +\ A_{0b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1}$$

Let's start with:

$$A_{1b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1}$$

If I tell you how many strings of length N-1 satisfy our condition C, adding a 1 to the left of a string of length N_1 will not generate new possibilities i.e. any string that we've counted among the strings of length N-1 we will also count if we add a 1 to the left and any string that we've not counted will still not be counted by adding the 1. Hence, in that case we can completely express our problem in terms of the solution of a smaller problem (of length N-1).

$$A_{1b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1}\ =\ A_{N-1}$$

On the other hand, in the case of  0, this is not true. If I give you a string of length N-1 that does not satisfy C but is of the form 0011111...then adding a zero to the left will actually generate some strings that we should count => 00011111...So for the cases of strings that have 0 at their left-most position, we need to distinguish more cases.

So in the case of 0 we repeat the same strategy. We distinguish two cases:

 

$$01b_{n-2}b_{n-3}...b_1$$

and

$$00b_{n-2}b_{n-3}...b_1$$

which similar to the case before lets us express:

$$A_{0b_{n-1}b_{n-2}...b_1}\ =\ A_{01b_{n-2}b_{n-3}...b_1}+A_{00b_{n-2}b_{n-3}...b_1}$$

If it is a 1 (i.e. the string starts with 01) then we're in a similar situation as before. If I give you the solution for strings of length N-2 then adding 01 to the left will not change that number. However, if we have 00 we have the same problem as before and we repeat the process one last time.



$$A_{00b_{n-2}b_{n-3}...b_1}\ =\ A_{001b_{n-3}b_{n-4}...b_1}\ +\ A_{000b_{n-3}b_{n-4}...b_1}$$

Here the recursion stops because 

$$A_{001b_{n-3}b_{n-4}...b_1}\ =\ A_{N-3}$$

and 

$$A_{000b_{n-3}b_{n-4}...b_1}$$

will count all the strings that start with 000 hence no matter the values for the remaining bits, they all satisfy the condition C.

Finally you add everything together.

Hope, that helped.",566222,2023-12-13T18:45:18.936148+11:00,2,3,English: I + action,12,2,"How many bit strings of length eight contain either three consecutive 0s or four consecutive 1s?
Denote by An the set of bit strings of length n that contain three consecutive 0s. We will try to find a
recurrence relation for computing |An|. Consider the first bit of a bit string X from the set An - if the
first bit is ’1’ then the remaining part of X is some bit string from the set An−1. If the first bit is ’0’ then
the remaining part can be from An−1, but it doesn’t have to (e.g. it can start with ’00’ and not contain
three consecutive, 00xxx...x). So let’s consider the first two bits of X: if they are ’01’ then the remaining
part of X is some bit string from An−2. If it is ’00’ then again, the remaining part can be from An−2 but
it doesn’t have to. So in this case we consider the third bit as well. If the first three bits are ’001’ then
the remaining part of X is some bit string from An−3. If the first three bits are ’000’ then the remaining
part of X can be any bit string of length n −3. To summarize, for X ∈An:
• If the first bit of X is ’1’, the rest of X can be any bit string from An−1
• If the first two bits of X are ’01’, the rest of X can be any bit string from An−2
• If the first three bits of X are ’001’, the rest of X can be any bit string from An−3
• If the first three bits of X are ’000’, the rest of X can be any bit string of length n −3
1
So, we have that |An| = |An−1| + |An−2| + |An−3| + 2n−3 for n ≥4. The initial conditions are obviously
A1 = A2 = 0 and A3 = 1. From this recurrence relation we compute |A8| = 107.","A similar analysis for bit strings of length n which contain 4 consecutive 1s, gives the recurrence
relation |Bn| = |Bn−1| + |Bn−2| + |Bn−3| + |Bn−4| + 2n−4 and we compute |B8| = 48.
We have computed the number of bit strings of length 8 which contain three consecutive zeros (|A8|)
and the number of bit strings of length 8 which contain four consecutive ones (|B8|). In order to compute
the number of bit strings of length 8 which contain either three consecutive 0s or four consecutive 1s we

there's something I don't understand in exercise 7. 
For example, if I want to calculate the probability of a three of a kind, at first I thought it was logical to calculate it like this:

C(13, 1) * C(4, 3) * C(12, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(11, 1) * C(4, 1)

But that's not right, because I have to replace :

C(12, 2) * (C(4, 2)^2).

Basis step: We can form 8 = 3 + 5, 9 = 3 + 3 + 3 and 10 = 5 + 5 cents with just 3 and 5 cents stamps.

I think that what you have done from line 4 -> line 5 is wrong. 
Disjunctive syllogism with lines 1 and 4, would imply that « There exists an x for which Q(x) holds » not « For all x, Q(x) holds ».

The intuition behind this reasoning is :
If for all x, you have either P(x) or Q(x) or both that holds (line 1), and that there is an x for which P(x) does not hold (line 4), then there is an x that « compensates » this x which makes P(x) not hold, that makes Q(x) hold.
It does not mean necessarily that Q(x) holds for EVERY x, only that it holds at minima on those that does not work for P(x). (It could, but not necessarily).
